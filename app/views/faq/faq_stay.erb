  Where can I stay?

<p>
We held a room block at the Country Inn and Suites (Isnâ€™t that nice of us?). The hotel is located at 5579 Spectrum Drive, Frederick, Maryland, about 30 minutes driving from the venue, with traffic. You can make a reservation under our names (Joslin-Verbeck) by clicking this link, <a href="https://www.countryinns.com/frederickmdjoslinverbeckwedding" class="related-link">https://www.countryinns.com/frederickmdjoslinverbeckwedding</a>, or calling 301-695-2881. Reserve by Tuesday, August 7 to get the $99 group rate. The group shuttle will pick up here. See the Internet for other hotel options.
