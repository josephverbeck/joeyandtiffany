    Can I bring my pet?

    Our dog will be joining us at the weddingâ€”we asked, and she said she prefers not to share the limelight. With that said, however, the Country Inn & Suites is pet friendly. They charge an additional $20 fee, but you are welcome to bring your pets to the hotel, as long as you plan for them to stay there during the actual wedding.
